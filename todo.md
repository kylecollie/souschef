Thinking of UI/UX, shoud ingredients be one text field rahter than quantiry/units/name?

Could I add a new, empty ingredient input row after a sucessful entry...in other words, not have to click link to add row
Same applies to directions and perhaps tags

Maybe auto-order instructions on entry but allow edit of order?

Maybe have navbar scroll with page?
