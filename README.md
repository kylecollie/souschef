# Sous Chef

The first and primary goal of this project is to provide me with a means of practicing the various skills and techniques that pique my curiosity. This includes, but is not limited to: MEAN Stack, Angular 2, git, markdown, etc.

The secondary goal is to create yet another recipe/cookbook application but with a twist. The plan is to connect the recipe with the cupboard inventory and that to a  system.
